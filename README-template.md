## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has amazing educative articles about programming language which helped me understand Bootstrap more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning how to code.
